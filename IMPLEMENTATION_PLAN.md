## 🔧 IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

### Critical Path (Start Today):
1. **Create missing page routes** for employee/contractor dashboards
2. **Complete authentication middleware** with role-based access
3. **Connect API endpoints** to existing UI components
4. **Test Docker environment** with new routing structure

### Development Commands:
```bash
# Start development environment
cd "C:\Users\sabir\.windsurf\Winsurf programs\01_EndlessOdyssey\Freelance\Snug and Kisses\CRM_for_snug_andkisses"
docker-compose up -d

# Test application
curl http://localhost:5369/api/health

# Deploy to Catalyst (when ready)
catalyst deploy --only functions
```

## 🚨 RISK MITIGATION

### Technical Risks:
- **Zoho API Rate Limits:** Implement caching and retry logic
- **Authentication Security:** Use secure JWT implementation
- **Data Privacy:** Ensure HIPAA compliance at every level

### Timeline Risks:
- **Scope Creep:** Focus on core functionality first
- **Integration Issues:** Test each component independently
- **Deployment Complexity:** Use staging environment
