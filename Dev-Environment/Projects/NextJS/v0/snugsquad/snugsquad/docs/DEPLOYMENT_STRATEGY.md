# Deployment Strategy

This document outlines our strategy for deploying the Next.js frontend application. This strategy is based on the official Next.js documentation and is designed to be compatible with our Replit hosting environment.

## Researched Deployment Options

Based on the official Next.js documentation, the primary deployment options are:

*   **Vercel:** The recommended platform for deploying Next.js applications, created by the same team.
*   **Node.js Server:** A traditional and flexible approach that allows for full feature support.
*   **Docker:** A container-based approach that provides a consistent and isolated environment.
*   **Static Export:** For purely static sites with no server-side rendering.

## Our Chosen Strategy

Given that we are using Replit for hosting, we will adopt the **Node.js Server** deployment strategy. This approach is fully supported by Replit and gives us the flexibility we need.

### Implementation Details

1.  **`package.json` scripts:** We will use the standard `build` and `start` scripts in our `package.json` file to build and run the production server.

    ```json
    {
      "scripts": {
        "dev": "next dev",
        "build": "next build",
        "start": "next start"
      }
    }
    ```

2.  **Replit `.replit` configuration:** We will configure the `.replit` file to use the `npm run start` command to run the application.

### Future Considerations: Docker

For a more robust and scalable deployment, we will consider using **Docker** in the future. This will involve:

1.  Creating a `Dockerfile` to containerize our Next.js application.
2.  Configuring Replit to build and run the Docker container.

This will be a task for a later stage of the project, once the initial application is up and running.
