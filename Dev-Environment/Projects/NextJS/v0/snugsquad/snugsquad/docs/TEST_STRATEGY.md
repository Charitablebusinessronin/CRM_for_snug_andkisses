# Test Strategy

This document outlines our testing strategy for the Snuggs & Kisses CRM project.

## Guiding Principles

*   **Quality is a team responsibility.** While James is the QA lead, everyone is responsible for the quality of their work.
*   **Automate everything.** We will strive to automate as much of our testing as possible to ensure consistency and speed.
*   **Test early and often.** We will integrate testing into every stage of the development process.

## Testing Levels

We will employ a multi-layered testing strategy, inspired by the testing pyramid.

### 1. Unit Tests

*   **Goal:** To test individual functions and components in isolation.
*   **Framework:** Jest
*   **Location:** `*.test.ts` files co-located with the code they are testing.
*   **Coverage Target:** 80% code coverage for all new code.

### 2. Integration Tests

*   **Goal:** To test the interaction between different parts of the application, such as the frontend and the backend API.
*   **Framework:** Jest and React Testing Library
*   **Location:** `*.test.ts` files.
*   **Coverage Target:** We will focus on testing the integration points between the UI and the Zoho Catalyst functions.

### 3. End-to-End (E2E) Tests

*   **Goal:** To test the application from the user's perspective, simulating real user scenarios.
*   **Framework:** Cypress
*   **Location:** A separate `cypress` directory.
*   **Coverage Target:** We will create E2E tests for all critical user flows, such as user registration, login, and the client portal features.

## Test Data

We will establish a set of mock data and fixtures to ensure our tests are consistent and repeatable. This data will be stored in the `cypress/fixtures` directory.

## CI/CD Integration

All tests (unit, integration, and E2E) will be run automatically in our CI/CD pipeline for every pull request. A pull request will not be mergeable if any of the tests fail.
