### Dependencies & Workflow

As the **Architect**, your designs are the first step.

*   **You depend on:** No one at the start! You can begin creating the designs and brand guidelines immediately.
*   **Who depends on you:**
    *   **Troy (the Builder)** needs your designs to build the user interface.
    *   **James (the Final Check)** needs your designs to know how the app should look and function when he is testing.

See `orderofoperations.md` for a simple guide to our team's workflow.

### Detailed Workflow with Troy (the Builder)

ðŸ”´ **IMPORTANT:** Follow these steps to ensure a smooth workflow with Troy.

**Phase 2: The Blueprints**

1.  **Your Task:** Create the "Wireframes and high-fidelity designs" for the **Client Portal** first, as this is Troy's first major UI task.

**Phase 3: Ongoing Collaboration**
