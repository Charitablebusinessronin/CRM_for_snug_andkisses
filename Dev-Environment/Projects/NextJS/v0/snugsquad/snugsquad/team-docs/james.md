### Detailed Workflow with Troy and Bobo

ðŸ”´ **IMPORTANT:** You are the gatekeeper of quality. Your work depends on both Troy and Bobo.

**Phase 1: Test Planning**

1.  **Your Task:** While Troy is developing and Bobo is setting up the infrastructure, your job is to "Define test strategy and coverage targets" and "Set up Jest and Cypress".
2.  **Your Action:** You can do this in parallel with their work.

**Phase 2: Testing Cycle**

1.  **Your Task:** You are assigned to test the "Client portal planned features".
2.  ðŸ”´ **STOP!** You cannot start testing until:
    *   **Troy** has deployed a version of the client portal to the testing environment.
    *   **Bobo** has confirmed that the testing environment is stable and ready for use.
3.  **Your Action:** Once the feature is ready for testing, execute your test plans.
4.  **HANDOFF:** If you find any bugs, create a detailed bug report and assign it to Troy.
