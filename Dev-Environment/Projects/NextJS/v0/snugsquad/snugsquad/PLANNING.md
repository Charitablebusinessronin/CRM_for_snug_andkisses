## Project Planning â€” Snuggs & Kisses CRM

This file is the high-level plan and architecture. Use it as the source of truth for decisions, stack, and conventions.

### Vision
Deliver a healthcare staffing platform for postpartum care with compliant data handling via Zoho One. Provide four role-based portals, assisted workflows, and operational automation.

### Architecture Overview
- UI: Next.js App Router with TypeScript + Tailwind
- Backend: Zoho Catalyst serverless functions (FaaS)
- Auth: Zoho Catalyst Embedded Auth SDK v4
- Data: Zoho CRM as primary datastore (no separate DBs)
- AI: Zia for matching, summarization, insights
- Hosting: Replit for web; Zoho Catalyst for FaaS

### Core Portals
1) Admin dashboard: user/role management, compliance monitoring, HR
2) Client dashboard: care plans, bookings, billing
3) Employee dashboard: availability, training, HR self-service
4) Contractor dashboard: job board, documents, earnings

### Compliance & Security
- Leverage Zoho One BAA, encryption, audit logs
- RBAC across portals; MFA required
- Session timeouts and secure storage of tokens

### Brand
- Colors: #3B2352, #D7C7ED, #D4AF37, #FFFFFF
- Typography: Merriweather (H), Lato (B), Dancing Script (quotes), Nunito Sans (UI)

### Milestones
- Phase 1/2: Foundations + dashboards
- Phase 3: Advanced features (Zia, contracts, billing), performance, monitoring
- Production hardening: security review, load testing, error budgets

### MCP/AI Assistant Workflow
- Use `TASK.md` to track granular work
- Keep files under 500 lines; split modules when needed
- Add unit tests for new features
- Update docs in `README.md` and here as architecture evolves

### Env & Deployment
- Required env vars are listed in `README.md`
- Replit: configure secrets and deploy web app
- Catalyst: deploy functions, configure credentials per environment
