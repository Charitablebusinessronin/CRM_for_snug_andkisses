## HIPAA-Compliant Security Framework

### Healthcare Data Protection Standards
Following medical documentation security requirements:
- All patient data encrypted with AES-256 at rest and TLS 1.3 in transit
- Role-based access controls (RBAC) for all healthcare information
- Audit logging for every PHI access event
- Data minimization principles applied to all user interfaces

### Authentication & Authorization Security
Multi-Factor Authentication requirements:
```text
const mfaConfig = {
  admin: 'required',
  hr: 'required',
  employee: 'conditional',
  contractor: 'optional',
  client: 'biometric_preferred'
};
```

Session Security standards:
- 15-minute timeout for PHI access sessions
- JWT tokens with healthcare-specific claims
- CSRF protection with SameSite cookies
- Session invalidation on role changes

### API Security Architecture
Serverless function security pattern:
```text
export async function secureHealthcareAPI(request: Request) {
  const user = await validateHealthcareSession(request);
  await enforceHIPAAPermissions(user, request.method, request.url);
  await logHealthcareInteraction(user.id, request.url, 'access_attempt');
  await enforceRoleBasedRateLimit(user.role);
  return sanitizeHealthcareResponse(response);
}
```

### Data Retention & Compliance
HIPAA retention requirements:
- Patient records: 7 years minimum retention
- Audit logs: 6 years minimum retention
- Training records: Employee duration + 3 years
- Incident reports: Permanent retention for compliance

Breach Response Protocol:
1. Detection & Containment (< 5 minutes)
2. Risk Assessment (< 30 minutes)
3. Notification Preparation (< 2 hours)
4. Regulatory Reporting (< 72 hours HIPAA requirement)
5. Remediation & Monitoring (Ongoing)

### Third-Party Integration Security
Zoho API security requirements:
- Business Associate Agreement (BAA) executed
- OAuth 2.0 with refresh token rotation
- API request signing for sensitive endpoints
- Circuit breakers for service availability
