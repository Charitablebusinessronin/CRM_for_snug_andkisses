## Actionable Runbook (Priya Sharma)

### 0) Operating Cadence

- **Progress updates:** 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%.
- **Plan hygiene:** Reread/adjust plan every 5 steps.

### 1) Prerequisites

- **Notion**: Provide page or database URL/ID for the knowledge base and task list.
- **Zoho Org**: Region (e.g., crm.zoho.com), Sandbox vs Production.
- **Auth**: Zoho OAuth self-client or server-based OAuth; confirm scopes and token storage.
- **Workspace Secrets**: Where to store secrets (env vars or secret manager).

### 2) Connect to Notion Knowledge Base

- **Goal**: Sync tasks and knowledge from Notion.
- **Inputs needed**: Notion page/database ID(s).
- **MCP Steps**:
  - Use `notion.search` to locate pages/databases by title.
  - Use `notion.get-block-children` to read page content.
  - Use `notion.create-page`/`notion.create-comment` to document outcomes.

### 3) Zoho OAuth Setup (Security-First)

1. Create/confirm Zoho self-client in Developer Console.
2. Define minimal scopes (principle of least privilege). Example: `ZohoCRM.modules.ALL`, `ZohoCRM.settings.ALL` as needed.
3. Generate grant token for the correct data center and org.
4. Exchange for access/refresh tokens; store securely.
5. Document scopes, rotation policy, and storage location in Notion.

### 4) Environment Configuration

- **env template** (example):

```bash
ZOHODC=us
ZOHO_CLIENT_ID=xxxx
ZOHO_CLIENT_SECRET=xxxx
ZOHO_REFRESH_TOKEN=xxxx
ZOHO_ORG_ID=xxxx
```

### 5) CRM Customization (Modules/Fields/Layouts)

- **Plan**: Define requirements in Notion (modules, fields, picklists, validation, blueprints).
- **Implement**: Via UI or API; version changes in Notion change-log.
- **Checklist**:
  - Custom module schema
  - Field-level validation
  - Workflows and assignment rules
  - Blueprint states and transitions

### 6) APIs & Integrations

- **Patterns**:
  - Idempotency keys for writes
  - Exponential backoff for rate limits
  - Webhooks for event-driven sync
- **Endpoints**: Records (CRUD), Search, Attachments.
- **Testing**: Use Postman collection or scripts; store sample payloads in Notion.

### 7) Serverless Functions

- **Deluge**: Create functions, parameterize secrets; log execution.
- **Catalyst**: Scaffold microservices; local testing; deploy.
- **Security**: Restrict function scopes and network egress where possible.

### 8) QA & Playwright

- **Flows to test**: Create Lead â†’ Qualify â†’ Convert; Custom module lifecycle; Webhook processing.
- **Artifacts**: Test plan, fixtures, and baseline runs captured in Notion.

### 9) Documentation

  - Requirements â†’ Designs â†’ Implementations â†’ Tests â†’ Runbooks â†’ Change log
  - Templates for PRDs, API contracts, and release notes

### 10) Security Controls

- **Scopes**: Least privilege; review quarterly.
- **Secrets**: Rotation schedule; audit access.
- **Logging**: Centralize audit and function logs.

### 11) Go/No-Go Checklist (Release)

- Requirements met and reviewed
- Tests passing; rollback plan documented
- Credentials verified and rotated as needed
- Runbook updated

### 12) Execution Steps (Quick Start)

1. Gather Notion IDs and Zoho org info.
2. Set up OAuth and env vars.
3. Confirm module/field specs in Notion and implement.
4. Build API integrations and webhooks.
5. Add tests; run end-to-end flows.
6. Document outcomes in Notion and update change log.
