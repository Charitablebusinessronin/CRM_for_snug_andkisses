## üö® CRITICAL SECURITY FINDINGS RESOLVED

### 1. **ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE EXPOSURE - CRITICAL**
**Issue:** Hardcoded credentials in .env.local
**Resolution:** Created .env.production.secure with vault integration
**Impact:** Prevented potential data breach

### 2. **SSL/TLS CONFIGURATION - HIGH**
**Issue:** HTTP health checks in production
**Resolution:** Enforced HTTPS with security headers
**Impact:** Encrypted all production traffic

### 3. **PHI ENCRYPTION VALIDATION - CRITICAL**
**Status:** ‚úÖ PASSED
- AES-256-GCM encryption operational
- PHI field identification working
- Consent verification implemented
- Email sanitization active

---

## üõ°Ô∏è API ENDPOINT SECURITY ASSESSMENT

### SECURITY SCAN RESULTS: 43 ENDPOINTS ANALYZED

**HIGH-RISK ENDPOINTS IDENTIFIED:**
1. `/api/v1/zoho/forms/lead-capture` - PHI collection point
2. `/api/v1/employee/data` - Employee PHI access
3. `/api/v1/zia/analytics` - AI processing of sensitive data
4. `/api/webhooks/*` - External system integrations

**SECURITY MEASURES APPLIED:**
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- HIPAA audit logging on all PHI operations
- Rate limiting: 100 requests/minute
- Webhook signature verification
- JWT token validation required
