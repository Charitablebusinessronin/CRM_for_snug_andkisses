# Priya's Brain Update - Snug & Kisses CRM

**Date:** 2025-08-07

**Status:** In Progress

## Summary of Changes

I have addressed the critical issues outlined in the `prompt.txt` file. The following changes have been made:

*   **Profile Management:**
    *   Created a new API route for profiles at `app/api/v1/profiles/route.ts`.
    *   Updated the `components/contractor-profile.tsx` component to use the new API route and to include the form handling logic.
*   **Authentication:**
    *   Created new authentication components at `components/auth/AuthWrapper.tsx` and `components/auth/LoginSection.tsx`.
*   **Database:**
    *   Created a new database connection file at `lib/database.ts`.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Created a new error boundary component at `components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`.

## Next Steps

*   I will now proceed to test the application to ensure that the fixes have been applied correctly and that the application is functioning as expected.
