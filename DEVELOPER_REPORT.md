## Development Decisions & Rationale

### 1. Zoho CRM Over Custom Database
**Decision:** Use Zoho CRM REST API for data storage  
**Rationale:** 
- Built-in HIPAA compliance
- No custom encryption needed
- Enterprise-grade security
- Integrated with client's existing Zoho One ecosystem

### 2. React-Player Over Custom Video Component
**Decision:** Use React-Player library for video integration  
**Rationale:**
- Broad format support (YouTube, Vimeo, direct files)
- Lightweight and performant
- Excellent TypeScript support
- Active maintenance and community

### 3. Direct REST API Over Zoho SDK
**Decision:** Use direct Zoho CRM REST API calls  
**Rationale:**
- Simpler implementation and debugging
- Better error handling control
- Reduced dependency complexity
- More reliable in serverless environments

### 4. Context API Over Redux
**Decision:** Use React Context for authentication state  
**Rationale:**
- Simpler for authentication-only state
- No external dependencies
- Better performance for small state trees
- Easier testing and maintenance
