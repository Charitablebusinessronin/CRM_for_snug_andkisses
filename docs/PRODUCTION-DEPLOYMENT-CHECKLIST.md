## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Environment Setup (COMPLETE! ‚úÖ)
```bash
# Your environment is already configured!
# Just copy the template to .env.local:
cp ops/env/env-vars-template.txt .env.local
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Catalyst
```bash
# Run the automated deployment script
node scripts/catalyst-deploy.js

# This will:
# - Deploy all 6 Catalyst functions
# - Create the DataStore with our schema
# - Validate environment configuration
# - Run basic tests
```

### Step 3: Post-Deployment Validation
```bash
# Run comprehensive tests
node scripts/test-catalyst-auth.js

# Start monitoring
node scripts/catalyst-monitor.js --monitor
```

## üîç Security Validation

### Authentication Flow
- [ ] Catalyst login page loads correctly
- [ ] User can authenticate via AppSail
- [ ] `sk.session` cookie is set securely
- [ ] Edge middleware processes session correctly
- [ ] User info is injected into headers
- [ ] API routes receive proper user context
- [ ] Role-based redirects work
- [ ] Logout clears session properly

### Function Security
- [ ] All 6 functions are deployed and accessible
- [ ] Functions respond to HTTP requests
- [ ] DataStore operations work securely
- [ ] HIPAA audit logging functions correctly
- [ ] Error handling doesn't expose sensitive information
- [ ] CORS is properly configured

### Data Protection
- [ ] DataStore encryption is enabled
- [ ] Access control is properly configured
- [ ] Audit trails are working
- [ ] Data retention policies are enforced
- [ ] PII is properly masked in logs

## üìä Performance Validation

### Response Times
- [ ] Authentication: < 500ms
- [ ] Function calls: < 1s
- [ ] DataStore queries: < 200ms
- [ ] Page load: < 2s for authenticated pages

### Monitoring
- [ ] Health monitoring is active
- [ ] Error rates are acceptable
- [ ] Performance metrics are being collected
- [ ] Alerts are configured for critical issues

## üö® Rollback Plan

### Quick Rollback
1. **Change Environment Variable**: Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_PROVIDER=nextauth`
2. **Restart Application**: The app will fall back to NextAuth
3. **Investigate Issues**: Use monitoring scripts to identify problems
4. **Fix and Retry**: Address issues and re-enable Catalyst mode

### Full Rollback
1. **Revert to Previous Version**: Use git to rollback to pre-migration state
2. **Restore Database**: If DataStore was created, remove it
3. **Remove Functions**: Use Catalyst CLI to remove deployed functions
4. **Restart with NextAuth**: Ensure the app works with the previous setup

## üìû Support Contacts

### Technical Issues
- **Catalyst Function Logs**: `catalyst functions logs <function-name>`
- **DataStore Status**: `catalyst datastore list`
- **Health Reports**: `monitor/health-check-*.jsonl`
- **Environment Check**: `node -e "console.log(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_PROVIDER)"`

### Emergency Contacts
- **Development Team**: Review logs and health reports
- **Zoho Support**: For OAuth or API issues
- **Catalyst Support**: For platform-specific issues

## üéØ Success Criteria

The production deployment is successful when:

1. ‚úÖ All Catalyst functions are deployed and accessible
2. ‚úÖ DataStore is created and operational
3. ‚úÖ Authentication flow works end-to-end
4. ‚úÖ All API routes use unified auth successfully
5. ‚úÖ Frontend components render correctly
6. ‚úÖ Performance meets or exceeds expectations
7. ‚úÖ HIPAA compliance is maintained
8. ‚úÖ All security requirements are met
9. ‚úÖ Monitoring and alerting are active
10. ‚úÖ Rollback procedures are tested and documented
